# Design Genie - Virtual Interior Design Tool

## Project Overview
The Virtual Interior Design Tool leverages AI to analyze room photos and recommend furniture, decor, and color schemes that match the roomâ€™s layout and style. It combines advanced deep learning techniques with user-friendly visualization methods to create a seamless virtual design experience.

## Features
- Detect existing furniture and decor items in user-uploaded room images.
- Generate design recommendations based on room layout and style.
- Visualize recommendations using 2D overlays and image inpainting.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VirtualInteriorDesignTool.git
   cd VirtualInteriorDesignTool

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Download the necessary datasets:

   - [MIT Places365]()
   - [SUN Dataset]()
   - Furniture and decor images from sites like IKEA, Wayfair, and Pinterest.

4. Set up directories

    ```bash
    mkdir -p data/raw data/processed data/annotations data/furniture_decor
    mkdir -p models/object_detection models/inpainting models/depth_estimation
    mkdir -p results/visualizations results/logs results/metrics

## Usage

1. Prepare Data:

    - Preprocess datasets using scripts in src/data_preprocessing/.

2. Train Models:

    - Train and fine-tune object detection models with src/object_detection/.

3. Run Recommendations:

   - Generate design suggestions using src/recommendation/.
   
4. Visualize:

    - Visualize recommendations using src/visualization/.
